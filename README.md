# Learning-PY-ML
Learning Python and DS/ML

I will use this repo to manage what I learn and develop in Python, Data Science (DS) and Machine Learning (ML).
I started #66DaysOfData challenge, for which I learn small chunk of DS, ML and Python. I will try to put those learnings (sample code snippets, notebooks, projects) here.

Also, I try to spend time in Kaggle to learn Python, ML and get hands on. If possible, I will put notebooks that I develop in Kaggle.
